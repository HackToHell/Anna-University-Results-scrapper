Anna University Result Scrapper
===============================

This pulls in data from aucode.annauniv.edu, the old one via spdir.nic.in doesn't work anymore and has been fixed,
this one is split by region so check the urls from that site and paste to scrip.py

For multiple colleges, reads from a csv called as clg.csv containing the list of colleges roll nos and start and end index.

Output is a json file.

TODO
====

+ Make it parallel
+ Better data structure
